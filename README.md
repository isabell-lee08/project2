## Project Overview

- The purpose of our project is to visualize a database relevant to us and its users, and allow for interaction from those users.
- Our project used the NYC Open Data for squirrels in Central Park. We hope our users come to appreciate the details of our furry friends here in the city.

## Features

- Interactable map to select squirrels
- Filter squirrels based on age, location, or color
- Interactable table to sort and select rows


## Technologies Used
